# Hematology_data_challenge

## Description
This repo is for the **Help a hematologist out** data challenge. The dataset and the information is available [here](https://helmholtz-data-challenges.de/web/challenges/challenge-page/93/overview)

The challenge is to develop models/techniques for domain adaptation. As a part of the ongoing study, the equivariant models indicated better generalization than conventional models. Through this challeneg we intend to test the hypothesis for domain adaptation problems.


## Installation
The ```environment.yml``` file can be used to create a conda env

## Usage
The ```train_book``` contains self explanatory code which can be used to train and test the developed equivariant models

## Support
For questions kindly open an issue.
